# Feature-Extraction-with-DIKS-for-HSI-Classification
A novel deep network with irregular convolutional kernels and self-expressive property (DIKS) for classification of hyperspectral images (HSIs).
This DIKS method mainly includes several convolution layers and one self-expression layer.
`CSL.m' is used to creat segmentation PATCH;
'CL.m' is the code of convolution layers;
'SL.m' is the code of self-expression layer;
'align_padding.p' is the aligning operation by padding to produce squire patches.

These codes are provided by Changda Xing, Ph.D, whose email is xingchangda@nuaa.edu.cn.
